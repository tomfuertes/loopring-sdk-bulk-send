## To Bulk Send

Once you've done the "Installation & Config" section below:

1. `cd loopring-sdk-bulk-send`
2. Paste your accounts to send to into `./accounts.txt` (ideally one per line but there's some automagical helper functions that might let you ctrl+a,ctrl+v whole twitter threads / reddit comment pages and it'll just work)
3. `node bulk-send.js` will walk you through the following options:

- `Pick an nft: [Array of IDs from your account]` - Select the NFT ID from the view page on explorer corresponding to the NFT you want to send

- `Pick a fee option USD $X.XX` - Select ETH or LRC to pay your fees. Estimated cost per send displayed in USDC.

- `Transfer to Y accounts: [list of accounts]` - Defaults to `N` for no if you hit enter. Type `y<enter>` to run. Helpful if you selected a wrong fee or NFT or it is too high.

## FAQ

* Only tested w/ a Metamask / Gamestop wallet Private Key
* "IsMobile any Navigator is undefined" is a message from the Loopring SDK running on node / not an issue.
* `status: processing` means success as far as I can tell
* if `code: undefined` or `message: undefined` do not show and instead show something else, it's likely an error and did not send
* The `Select NFT by ID` question can be found at the top of an explorer page (e.g., `0x32f006a901505c8c015714cc4390f7f5447c1b07983b050c9cd92da90777584c` for [this NFT](https://explorer.loopring.io/nft/0xb6a1df588d2cb521030a5269d42a9c34f1ecaeab-0-0x92f7c57650b6dae91b8a8d73b1fb90f70b39358e-0x32f006a901505c8c015714cc4390f7f5447c1b07983b050c9cd92da90777584c-10))

Code is provided as is. No direct help offered here or in DM if npm / node errors aren't approachable for you. Happy to link to resources that are more step by step as they're created.
